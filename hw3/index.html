    <p> I grew up in a small town called Iona, which resides in the community known as Belfast in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Growing up on a farm for most of my childhood we grew many different types of crop, one specifically being, potatoes which
        are
        one of PEI's largest exports. After leaving the farm at the age of 10, I moved into a period in my life where sports took over (11-18), playing hockey, football and baseball, while participating in other sports such as badminton, volleyball,
        wrestling,
        softball and a few more sports.

    <p> After high school I attended <a class="college" href="http://www.hollandcollege.com/"> <i>Holland College</i></a> in Prince Edward Island, and studied Sport and Leisure Management. One year later following my graduation at Holland College, I
        attended
        <a class="uni" href="http://www.westfield.ma.edu/academics/degrees/exercise-science-major"> <i>Westfield State University</i></a> studying Movement Science with a consentration in Exercises Science. As a post grad I worked in a few different
        fields, led me
        to my current fulltime role as a Coporate Health Fitness Specialist/RT. Here I excelled, but felt I needed to do more and make an impact to feel more fulfilled with what I do. I didn't feel challenged enough, and grew bored with what I did.
    </p>
    <p>This helped open my eyes and lead me towards a new path which is persuing a passion that has always interested me, which brought forth the opportunity to seek higher education and become more skilled. I quickly begin taking the <a
            class="business" href="https://www.uml.edu/MSB/Programs/Masters-Programs/<Foundations-of-></Foundations-of->Business.aspx"> <b>Foundations of Business Certificate</b></a> at <a class="uml" href="https://www.uml.edu/"> <i>UMass
                Lowell</i></a>, to move towards my future goals of obtaining my MBA, which allow me to be more involved within a business and to eventually become a manager.</p>
